Welcome to the "Pathfinding and Maze Generation Algorithms Visualizer" project!

In this project, you can explore the execution of various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. The goal is to make it easier for you to understand how these algorithms work and to compare their performance on different input data. 

To get started, simply choose an algorithm from the list on the left and adjust any relevant settings. The visualization will show the steps of the algorithm as it executes on the input data. You can also use the controls at the bottom of the screen to speed up or slow down the visualization, or to step through the algorithm one step at a time.

Included Pathfinding Algorithms:  

1. Dijkstra's algorithm 
2. A* (A-star) algorithm
3. Greedy best-first search
4. Swarm algorithm 
5. Convergent swarm algorithm
6. Bidirectional swarm algorithm 
7. Breadth-first search
8. Depth-first search 

Included Maze Generation Algorithms:  

1. Recursive division 
2. Recursive division (vertical skew) 
3. Recursive division (horizontal skew) 
4. Basic random maze 
5. Basic weight maze
